# COVID-19-CNN-Image-Detection-from-Lung-X-Rays

This project aims to take an chest X-Ray image and detect if the patient has the COVID-19 infection. It uses a CNN to train on a large dataset of both normal and COVID lung images to learn how to process the difference in both images.

"COVID_19_Detector.ipynb" is a python file that can be opened in Google Colab that takes in the data and uses a CNN to process the images.

"xray_check.ipynb" is a python code we found on https://github.com/rani700/xray that shows the visual on how image segmentation can work on chest X-Ray. We included this to show visually what our CNN could be processing in differentiating between COVID lungs or not.
